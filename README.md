## Prerequisites
- A WordPress website hosted on a VPS (Virtual Private Server)
- A Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, etc.) containing your WordPress theme and/or plugin code
- GitHub account and access to the repository
- A private key file generated on your VPS server for authentication

## Step 1: Set up the GitHub Actions Workflow
1. In your Git repository, navigate to the `.github/workflows` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).
2. Create a new workflow file, e.g., `wordpress-deploy.yml`.
3. Add the following content to the workflow file
4. Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:
   - `THEME_DIR`: The directory containing your WordPress theme files.
   - `PLUGIN_DIR`: The directory containing your WordPress plugin files.
   - `VPS_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of your VPS server.
   - `VPS_USER`: The username for your VPS server.

## Step 2: Add the VPS Private Key as a GitHub Secret
1. In your GitHub repository, go to the "Settings" tab.
2. In the left-hand menu, click on "Secrets".
3. Click on "New repository secret".
4. Name the secret `VPS_PRIVATE_KEY` and copy the contents of your VPS server's private key file.

## Step 3: Test the GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch of your Git repository.
2. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to see the progress of the deployment workflow.
3. If the workflow completes successfully, your WordPress theme and/or plugin should be deployed to your VPS server.

## Step 4: Automate the Deployment Process
1. Set up a trigger to automatically run the GitHub Actions workflow when you push changes to the `main` branch.
2. Consider adding additional steps to the workflow, such as:
   - Validating the WordPress theme and/or plugin code
   - Performing unit tests
   - Compressing and/or optimizing the deployed files

By using a private key for authentication, you've improved the security of your CI/CD workflow. This ensures that your VPS server can be accessed without exposing a password, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
